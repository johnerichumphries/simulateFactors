Description: This file simulates a system of (binary and continuous) equations
    where the dependent variable is determined by observed covariates and
    unobserved factors. You can specify a fair amount about the system of
    equations, including support for correlated factors and a simple way to
    specify exclusion restrictions. This code is meant purely for testing and
    debugging factor models
