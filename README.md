simulateFactors
===============

simulates a factor model in R for debugging and testing factor models. 

This package has a single function which generates random simulated data from a system of equations. 

The equations can be linear or binary models which are determined by a linear combination of observable and unobservable components and random noise.

The function call saves the simulated data to memory, but also writes the data to disk and outputs a list of the variable names.
